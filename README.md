OBJECTIVE:-
Build a TODO app with React and Redux 

This assignment is about creating a React and Redux Todo List app. User can add new todos, mark as completed, remove a todo, and filter todos. This assignment is to test your knowledge on Action, Reducers, Store, and Components. 

 

React UI Components:- 

We have implemented our React UI components as follows: 

1.TodoApp is the entry component for our app. It renders the header, the AddTodo, TodoList, and VisibilityFilters components. 

2.AddTodo is the component that allows a user to input a todo item and add to the list upon clicking its ‚ÄúAdd Todo‚Äù button. 

3.TodoList is the component that renders the list of todos . 

4.Todo is the component that renders a single todo item: 

5.VisibilityFilters renders a simple set of filters: all, completed, and incomplete. 

 

The Redux Store 

The Redux portion of the application  

Store 

Action 

Reducers 
 

Providing the Store 

create store in our app and wrap our app with the <Provider />. 

 
  
Connecting the Components 

React Redux provides a connect function for you to read values from the Redux store.  use 

MapStateToProps 

MapDispatchToProps 

 

Provide a login and password form and after accepting the user info (no authentication) display the user info on the right hand side of nav bar in todo list page.
